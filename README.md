Gee Pee
=======

Gee Pee is a ruidimentary genetic programming system that strives to produce a
mathematical expression approximating the trigonometric function f(x)=sin(x)
over a given domain, using only the four arithmetical operators.  Written
entirely in Javascript, Gee Pee runs in a web browser and takes advantage of
HTML5's Canvas and Web Workers -- the former permits graphical rendering of its
progress in real time, while the latter allows its intensive computations to
run in a separate thread, maintaining a responsive user interface.

Gee Pee is based on the techniques presented in [_A Field Guide to Genetic
Programming_](http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/).
